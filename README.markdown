# Amber Alert API Libraries

This is a multi-language library for getting AmberAlert details by state
and case number. Right now, it only supports PHP, but that will change.

## AmberAlert API?

Right now, there isn't a natural way to "programmatically" pull AmberAlert 
data from either AmberAlert.gov or the National Center for Missing Children.
Developers who want to help the cause should really have a REST API made
available to them (or anything, I'll take XMLRPC if I have to).

The methodology of this library is to use NCMC's internal webservice call
intented for their online "poster", which contains all the missing person
information.

For a call to get missing persons by state, it first reads the publically
available RSS feed, parses out the case number, and uses that case number to
call the aforementioned webservice call.
